# Problem

## Goal: Improve station-based car sharing models

### Value proposition
        * it means to increase engagement while reducing CO^2 emissions
        * maximize utilization rate to cover the costs of landlords
        * maximize number of bookings -> gamification(challenge, fun, rewards)
        * minimize number of late returns
        * Improve charging behaviour of users
        * Reduce greenhouse effect


### Context
    * Pick up vehicle from a nearby station and bring it
      back to the same place
    * 650.000 registered users, 11.200 available vehicles, 5.700 stations
        -> optimization problem ?

### Further infos
      * e.Base home -> station based carsharing service
      *
