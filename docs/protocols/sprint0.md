# Problem

## Goal: Improve station-based car sharing models

### Value proposition
        * maximize utilization rate to cover the costs of landlords
        * maximize number of bookings -> gamification(challenge, fun, rewards)
        * minimize number of late returns
        * Improve charging behaviour of users
        * Reduce greenhouse effect


### Context
    * Pick up vehicle from a nearby station and bring it
      back to the same place
    * 650.000 registered users, 11.200 available vehicles, 5.700 stations
        -> optimization problem ?

### Further infos
      * e.Base home -> station based carsharing service



## Team discussion

### 1.) What did I understand from the task ?
        * Landlords want to provide car sharing service to their tenants
            * High incentive by new law
            * Income stream
  
        * Three main design goals of the service:
            * Maximize the customer utilization / number of bookings
  
            * Minimize the number of late returns
            * Improve charging behaviour of users
  
            * Reduce CO^2 emissions
            * Service should be comfortable for landlords and tenants
            * Low cost
            * Maximize car availability -> carpooling

        * Constraints:
            * The car always has to get back to the same place
            * No inter-optimization between landlords
  
        * Source codes on githubs
        * Documentation as well
        * Website/Webservice: Visual feedback for car-interaction and booking


### 2.) What do I think the solution is going to look like ?
        * Abdullah:
            * So many points :)
        * Ananya:
            * Landlord: Make sure usability increases
            * Indicator for how much CO^2 has been saved
            * Niceness factor -> Goes up by filling the petroleum
            * Landlord gives insurance for the car
            * New tenants give their general roadmap when they
              move to the new place
            * The more you use the car, the cheaper it gets
  

        * Benedikt:
            * Problem: Use the car for a longer time
            * The longer the trip is the more expensive it gets
            * If time series analysis suggests that a person can not book
              the car for a long time, then booking is not permitted
            * Booking transparency

        * Felix:
            * Frontend which simplifies the booking process
            * User interface reminds you about charging and cleaning the car
            * Give the user a good feeling
            * Battery forcasting

        * Thomas:
            *
